# UK-Housing-Paid-Data

A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting UK housing prices using data science and machine learning techniques.

## UK Housing Paid Data Analysis

This repository contains the **UkHousingPaidDataMan.ipynb**, **ukHousingDataRevisted.ipynb**, and **ukHousingDataMoreFeatures.ipynb** Jupyter Notebooks, which are part of an ongoing project aimed at analyzing UK housing data. The project leverages various data science and machine learning libraries to provide insights and predictions about the UK housing market.

### Project Overview

The **UkHousingPaidDataMan.ipynb** and **ukhousingDataMoreFeatures.ipynb** notebooks include the following features:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Utilizes libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses seaborn for visualizing data trends and distributions, including new geolocation features that enhance our understanding of housing prices across different regions.
- **Geolocation Analysis**: Implements techniques to create geolocation features, allowing for more refined predictions based on geographical data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements machine learning models using fastai, scikit-learn, and other libraries to predict housing prices.
- **Model Interpretation**: Employs tools like dtreeviz and treeinterpreter to visualize and interpret decision trees and random forests.

### Performance Metrics

Recent model scores using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) indicate an improvement in performance:

#### Previous Scores:
- **Training RMSE**: `0.382631`
- **Validation RMSE**: `0.544589`

#### New Scores in **ukHousingDataMoreFeatures.ipynb**:
- **Training RMSE**: Decreased from `0.382631` to `0.3839`.
- **Validation RMSE**: Dropped from `0.544589` to `0.542527`.

Although the improvements are small, they show progress in the modelâ€™s ability to generalize and predict housing prices more accurately.

### Next Steps

The next step in the project will be to explore the use of **neural networks** to further enhance our predictions and improve the model's performance. This approach will allow us to capture more complex relationships in the data and potentially reduce errors.

### Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- fastbook
- fastai
- scikit-learn
- dtreeviz
- seaborn
- IPython

### Contributing

This is an ongoing project, and there are many features and improvements that can be added. Some of the areas that need more work include:

- **Data Enrichment**: Adding more datasets to enrich the analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Implementing more advanced machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Enhancing model evaluation techniques and metrics.
- **Visualization**: Adding more visualizations to better understand the data and model predictions.
