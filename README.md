# UK-Housing-Paid-Data
A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting UK housing prices using data science and machine learning techniques.

UK Housing Paid Data Analysis
This repository contains the UkHousingPaidDataMan.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, which is an ongoing project aimed at analyzing UK housing data. The project leverages various data science and machine learning libraries to provide insights and predictions about the UK housing market.

Project Overview
The UkHousingPaidDataMan.ipynb notebook includes the following features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilizes libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses seaborn for visualizing data trends and distributions.
Machine Learning Models: Implements machine learning models using fastai, scikit-learn, and other libraries to predict housing prices.
Model Interpretation: Employs tools like dtreeviz and treeinterpreter to visualize and interpret decision trees and random forests.

Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
fastbook
fastai
scikit-learn
dtreeviz
seaborn
IPython
